                                <p>Our first dwelling – The Lantern – is designed by Emulsion and inspired by the iconic idea of a lantern to sit serenely within the landscape. After our previous land-partner unfortunately had to put our project on hold, we’re currently looking for a new site to call The Lantern’s first home. We’re still hoping to bring The Lantern to you on an equally if not more beautiful site in North Norfolk later in 2019 for an initial period of one year.</p>

                                        <p>The Lantern will be a gently glowing translucent structure encased in a natural woven lattice to sit sensitively and serenely within the landscape. The sleeping and living spaces will inhabit a central core, inviting movement around the outer edge and providing continuous contact with The Lantern’s translucent envelope. Glass doors will offer panoramic views across the landscape and roof lights will act as periscopes, bringing glimpses of the landscape and environment directly onto the mirror-clad heart of the dwelling. As the outside world morphs and changes so will the space inside, enhancing your awareness of and relationship with the elements and landscape around you.</p>
                                        <p>With one double and two single beds, a small kitchenette, bathroom, dining and lounge areas and a 360-degree terrace all constructed to an exceptional standard, you will enjoy a comfortable stay at The Lantern with family or friends in any season. Seating platforms will be scattered around the surrounding meadow to further enhance your immersion in the landscape.</p>
                                        <p>The Lantern will be highly efficient and have a low environmental impact; the structure's lifetime will be long yet, being portable, it will have no lasting impact on any of its locations.</p>

                                        <p>Emulsion is an architecture and design studio in London.</p>
                                        <p>Established by Yen-Yen Teh and Michael Deeley in 2009, Emulsion is a mix of ideas, materials and people. Their passion is in the process, taking a collaborative and holistic approach to all their work and thriving on the relationships that they form along the way.</p>
                                        <p>It was Emulsion’s open and creative approach to design that led Land Stories to commission them for the first dwelling. Land Stories needed an architect to develop a concept independent of location and take an approach more akin to creating a sculpture than constructing a traditional dwelling. On designing The Lantern, practice director Yen-Yen Teh says:</p>
                                        <p>"We were inspired by the simple idea of a lantern acting as a gentle beacon which can sit sensitively in the landscape. A lattice of woven willow encases the dwelling space, the irregularity of the natural willow contrasting the glowing faces of the enclosure. It will be a very serene and beautiful place to stay in any landscape.”</p>
                                        <p>Emulsion’s work has been published worldwide including in Dezeen (UK), Wallpaper (UK), Monitor (Russia), Grafik (UK) and Blueprint (UK).</p>

                                        <p>Millimetre is a multi-award-winning community of bold, playful and meticulous makers and designers based in Brighton who work on an incredibly wide range of projects in architecture, art, furniture, interiors and lighting. Established in 2006, the team has now worked on over 100 projects from conceptualisation and design through to manufacture, development and installation.</p>
                                        <p>Millimetre is known for combining grand scale with tiny detail and has worked in conjunction with leading artists, architects and global brands such as Grayson Perry on A House for Essex, Make architects, Living Architecture's A Room for London, BMW, London Design Festival, Victoria & Albert Museum, Channel 4, Science Museum, RCA, Transport for London to produce some of the UK’s most talked-about pieces.</p>
                                        <p>The Lantern required a specialist fabricator for its construction, rather than a traditional building contractor, and Millimetre was commissioned for being highly experienced in this while also offering a high level of creative input, an exceptional level of workmanship and always considering the environmental impact of the product.</p>

                                        <h3>Penny Hughes, poet and photographer</h3>
                                        <p>Nature and identity inform much of the work of poet and photographer Penny Hughes. Land Stories invited Penny to collaborate on a series of poems and photographs inspired by the landscape. In these images, taken over eight years on the North Norfolk coast where she grew up, space and light are used to examine tensions between time, nature and self. Penny’s work provides a thought-provoking and sometimes idiosyncratic take on the location that we hope will still be The Lantern’s first home.</p>
                                        <p>A selection of Penny's limited edition photographic prints and postcards are available in <a href="loader.html">our shop.</a></p>
                                        <p>Penny’s poetry collection, “Girl, falling”, is forthcoming through Gatehouse Press.</p>
