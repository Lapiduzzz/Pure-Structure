                            <p>Escape to architect-designed small-scale dwellings in some of our finest locations. Pure Structure is a celebration of architecture, sustainable design and natural beauty.</p>
                            <p>Explore how contemporary architecture can shine a light on our landscapes and enhance our relationship with nature. Free from the constraints of traditional architecture, each installation will feel like a piece of art, offering the quality and comfort of a hotel suite yet leaving no trace within the environment.</p>
                            <p>Collaboration sits at the heart of our idea. Working closely with a select group of architects, craftspeople, interior designers and artists, we aim to create a collection of unique dwellings that will live for a limited period in some of the UK’s magnificent landscapes. These hard-wearing and low-impact portable structures will combine simple beauty with comfort, paying tribute to architectural craftsmanship and the wild beauty of our landscapes. With a short build and installation time, it will be possible to bring a new Pure Structure to you within just a few months.</p>
                            <p>Artists will be invited to stay and asked to create a piece of work inspired by their experience. Over the course of the project’s life-span, we plan to curate a collection of lasting memories that include music, poetry, print, photography and film to tell the Pure Structure tale.</p>

                            <p>Our first dwelling - The Lantern - is inspired by the iconic idea of a lantern, to sit serenly within the landscape. Sleeping four, it will combine the quality and comfort of a modern hotel suite with an immersive camping experience. Visit our Early Adopter shop for a range of our collaborators' and own exclusive products while we work to settle The Lantern in its first home.</p>

                        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>Pure Structure was born out of our founder’s curiosity with mobile homes and their ability to free us from the constraints of normal life and enable us to experience untouched places and spaces. Uninspired by their quality and design, she set out to explore the concept of temporary architecture as a place to stay and to see what kind of experiences could be created within our open landscapes.</p>
                        <p>Architecture has the potential to elevate the humble mobile home, taking it beyond the mundane and into the realm of contemporary art and living spaces. This is about exploring new structures, experimenting with new and sustainable materials, and building intimacy with our landscapes for a brief period of time.</p>
                        <p>Pure Structure is a non-profit initiative; all profits are used to fund future projects.</p>
